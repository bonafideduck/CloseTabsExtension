There are two ways to request support with issues or request a feature.

| Create an Issue | Send an Email |
|:---:|:---:|
| If you have a github account, you may directly [create an issue](https://github.com/bonafideduck/CloseTabsExtension/issues/new/choose). | Although creating an issue in github is preferred, you may also [send an email](mailto:closetabs@patnan.com) to the author. |
