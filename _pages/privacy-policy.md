We do not collect or store your data when using the app. We do not track your behavior or gather statistics without your consent.
Your data is not sent over the network.  The app itself uses, but does not store, the following information:

1. URLs of web pages visited within Safari.
2. The timestamp of when a tab loads a page URL.
3. The timestamp of when a tab comes into focus.

In the rare event that a person (referred to as client during these discussions) is having issues with this tool,
the developer of CloseTabs may interact with that client requesting that logs be created and exported from the 
Console tool.  The information logged could include three items of information listed above and the decisions 
made by CloseTabs.  Such access requires manual actions of the client and cannot be enabled by the developer of 
CloseTabs without this manual action by the client.
